  Utilize IRS to reflect and redirect signals around obstacles, minimizing signal blockage and coverage holes.

- **Dynamic IRS Phase Adjustment**  
  Develop an AI-driven system to dynamically and autonomously control the IRS phase shifts for optimal beamforming.

- **Minimize Power Consumption**  
  Reduce the need for deploying additional base stations by efficiently leveraging IRS, lowering power and deployment costs.

- **Maximize Key Performance Metrics**  
  - **Signal-to-Interference-Noise Ratio (SINR)**
  - **Spectral Efficiency (SE)**
  - **Minimize Bit Error Rate (BER)**
  - **Minimize Outage Probability**

- **Enhance Adaptability and Scalability**  
  Implement **Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)** to enable real-time, distributed, and scalable optimization of beamforming in dynamic and heterogeneous 5G environments.

- **Support for High Mobility and Multi-User Scenarios**  
  Build a robust AI-powered framework capable of maintaining reliable connections and high performance even in high-mobility and multi-user 5G use cases.
